# QA Automation Scripts
Welcome to my automation testing project! This repository contains scripts built with **Selenium**, **Selenide**, **Java**, **Gradle**, and **JUnit** to test website functionality, like field validation and info checks.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Automate Support page functionality
- **Tools**: 
  - Selenium & Selenide for browser automation.
  - Java as the programming language.
  - Gradle for build management.
  - JUnit5 for test assertions.
  - IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE.
    
## How It Works
These scripts:
- Automate fields
- Automate wrong credentials checks.
- Automate successful submission info to support
- Make sure the front-end is working.
- Make sure the back-end is working.
- Make sure the data base is working.
 - UPDATES:
- Added TestData with Java Faker - now input data is changing from test to test.
- Added Allure Reports
- Added CI enviroment - remote GitHub repository
